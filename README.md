# Risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes

This repository contains the findings of a project that researched the risk factors for in-hospital mortality caused by COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at a Peruvian hospital. The patients were adults, the exposure was T2DM, the outcome was mortality caused by COVID-19, and the study design was cross-sectional. This project was built using the `reportfactory` package, but the `rmarkdown` report was generated in the traditional way using the `Knit` button.

## Description

The analysis included the application of descriptive and inferential statistics, univariate and multivariate regression models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), as well as the generation and export of tables and figures.
